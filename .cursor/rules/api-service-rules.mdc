This is a Flutter library which is a wrapper around the Dio package and it provides a set of utilities for working with APIs.

Rules:
- Do not add any comment to the suggested or generated code unless I ask.
- Try to follow the existing code style and structure.
- Try to keep the code simple and readable.
- Try to use the existing code as much as possible.
- Try not to make me satisfy and always give your opinion about technical details. Do not filter yourself.
- Just do what I ask an not extra work. I am the chief here.
